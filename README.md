# FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is a self-paced, open-source coding curriculum. The curriculum contains front end, data visualization, back end, and full stack material.

#### Front End Certification [IN PROGRESS]

Practiced skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

To earn this certification, you must build 10 front end projects and implement JavaScript algorithms.
