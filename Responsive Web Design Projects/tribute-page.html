                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1898</strong> - Had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students(Age
                        11).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1901</strong> - Was receiving merit certificates and academic awards(Age 14).</li>
                    <li><strong>1902</strong> - Went on to find his own method to solve the quartice quations.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1903</strong> - Studied the contents of the book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results ,
                        which is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening the genius of Ramanujan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1904</strong> - Graduated from Town Higher Secondary School, was awarded the K.
                        Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1905</strong> - Ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam and stayed in
                        Rajahmundry for about a month.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1906</strong> - Failed his Fellow of Arts exam and again a year later. Without a degree,
                        he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics. At this point in
                        his life, he lived in extreme poverty and was often on the brink of starvation.
                    </li>

                        <strong>1913</strong> - Wrote to G. H. Hardy. Hardy recognised some of Ramanujan's formulae but
                        others "seemed scarcely possible to believe". Hardy wrote a letter to Ramanujan, expressing his
                        interest for his work. Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan for Ramanujan's trip to
                        Cambridge. Ramanujan refused to leave his country to "go to a foreign land".
                    </li>

                        Goddess commanded her "to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's
                        purpose". Ramanujan then set sail for England.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1916</strong> - Was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree.</li>
                    <li>
